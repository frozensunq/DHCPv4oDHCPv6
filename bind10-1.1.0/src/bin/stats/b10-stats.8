.SH "NAME"
b10-stats \- BIND 10 statistics module
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBb10\-stats\fR\ 'u
\fBb10\-stats\fR [\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-\-verbose\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-stats\fR
daemon collects statistics data from each BIND 10 module\&. Its statistics information may be reported via
\fBbindctl\fR
or
\fBb10\-stats\-httpd\fR\&. It is started by
\fBb10\-init\fR
and communicates by using the Command Channel by
\fBb10\-msgq\fR
with other modules like
\fBb10\-init\fR,
\fBb10\-auth\fR
and so on\&.
\fBb10\-stats\fR
periodically requests statistics data from each module\&. The interval time can be configured via
\fBbindctl\fR\&.
\fBb10\-stats\fR
cannot accept any command from other modules for updating statistics data\&. The stats module collects data and aggregates it\&.
\fBb10\-stats\fR
invokes an internal command for
\fBb10\-init\fR
after its initial starting to make sure it collects statistics data from
\fBb10\-init\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
This enables maximum debug logging\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION AND COMMANDS"
.PP
The only configurable setting in
stats\&.spec
is:
.PP
\fIpoll\-interval\fR
.RS 4
is a time interval in seconds at which
\fBb10\-stats\fR
requests each module to return its statistics data\&. The default is 60 seconds\&. Polling can be disabled by setting it to 0\&. The type of the value should be an unsigned integer\&. Negative integers are ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
The configuration commands are:
.PP

\fBshow\fR
will send the statistics data in JSON format\&. By default, it outputs all the statistics data it has collected\&. An optional item name may be specified to receive individual output\&.
.PP

\fBshowschema\fR
will send the schema of the statistics data in JSON format\&. The output is equivalent to the statistics part of
stats\&.spec\&.
.PP

\fBshutdown\fR
will shutdown the
\fBb10\-stats\fR
process\&. This has an optional
\fIpid\fR
argument to select the process ID to stop\&. (Note that the b10\-init process may restart this service if configured\&.)
.PP

\fBstatus\fR
simply indicates that the daemon is running\&.
.SH "STATISTICS DATA"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-stats\fR
daemon contains these
\(lqStats\(rq
statistics:
.PP
boot_time
.RS 4
The date and time when this daemon was started in ISO 8601 format\&. This is a constant which can\'t be reset except by restarting
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
last_update_time
.RS 4
The date and time (in ISO 8601 format) when this daemon last received data from another component\&.
.RE
.PP
lname
.RS 4
This is the name used for the
\fBb10\-msgq\fR
command\-control channel\&. (This is a constant which can\'t be reset except by restarting
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&.)
.RE
.PP
report_time
.RS 4
The latest report date and time in ISO 8601 format\&.
.RE
.PP
start_time
.RS 4
This is the date and time (in ISO 8601 format) when this daemon started collecting data\&.
.RE
.PP
timestamp
.RS 4
The current date and time represented in seconds since UNIX epoch (1970\-01\-01T00:00:00Z) with precision (delimited with a period) up to one hundred thousandth of second\&.
.RE
.PP
See other manual pages for explanations for their statistics that are kept track by
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/usr/local/share/bind10/stats\&.spec
\(em This is a spec file for
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&. It contains commands for
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&. They can be invoked via
bindctl(1)\&.
