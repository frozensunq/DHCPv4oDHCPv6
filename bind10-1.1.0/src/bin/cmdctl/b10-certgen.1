.SH "NAME"
b10-certgen \- X509 Certificate generation tool for use with b10\-cmdctl
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBb10\-certgen\fR\ 'u
\fBb10\-certgen\fR [[\fB\-\fR]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-certgen\fR
tool validates, creates, or updates a self\-signed X509 certificate for use in b10\-cmdctl\&.
.PP
The connection between
\fBbindctl\fR
and
\fBb10\-cmdctl\fR
is done over HTTPS, and therefore
\fBb10\-cmdctl\fR
needs a certificate\&. Since these certificates have expiry dates, they also need to be regenerated at some point\&. There are many tools to do so, but for ease of use,
\fB b10\-certgen\fR
can create a simple self\-signed certificate\&. By default, it will not create anything, but it will merely check an existing certificate (if not specified, cmdctl\-certfile\&.pem, in the current working directory)\&. And print whether it is valid, and whether it would update if the option \'\-w\' is given\&. With that option, the certificate could then be replaced by a newly created one\&. If the certificate is still valid, it would still not be overwritten (however, if it is found to be invalid, for example because it has expired, it would create a new one)\&. A new certificate is always created if the certificate file does not exist, or if creation is forced (with the \-f option)\&.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.PP
\fB\-c \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR, \fB\-\-certfile=\fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.RS 4
File to read the certificate from, or write the certificate to\&. If
\fB\-w\fR
and
\fB\-c\fR
are used,
\fB\-k\fR
is mandatory as well\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 4
Force updating of certificate when
\fB\-w\fR
is used, even if the existing certificate is still valid\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Print the command line arguments and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-k \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR, \fB\-\-keyfile=\fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.RS 4
File to write the private key to\&. This option is only valid when
\fB\-w\fR
is used, and if this option is used,
\fB\-c\fR
is mandatory as well\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-write\fR
.RS 4
Check the given certificate file\&. If it does not exist, a new private key and certificate are created\&. If it does exist, the certificate is validated\&. If it is not valid (for instance because it has expired), it is overwritten with a newly created certificate\&. If it is valid, nothing happens (use
\fB\-f\fR
to force an update in that case)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Don\'t print informational messages (only command\-line errors are printed)\&. Useful in scripts when only the return code is needed\&.

.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-certgen\fR
tool was first implemented in November 2012 for the ISC BIND 10 project\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
To update an expired certificate in BIND 10 that has been installed to /usr/local:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$> cd /usr/local/etc/bind10/

$> b10\-certgen
cmdctl\-certfile\&.pem failed to verify: certificate has expired
Running with \-w would overwrite the certificate

$> b10\-certgen \-\-write
cmdctl\-certfile\&.pem failed to verify: certificate has expired
Creating key file cmdctl\-keyfile\&.pem
Creating certificate file cmdctl\-certfile\&.pem

$> b10\-certgen \-\-write
cmdctl\-certfile\&.pem is valid
Not creating a new certificate (use \-f to force)
