      This document lists each message that can be logged by the
      programs in the BIND 10 package.  Each entry in this manual
      is of the form:
      </p><pre class="screen">IDENTIFICATION message-text</pre><p>
      ... where "IDENTIFICATION" is the message identification included
      in each message logged and "message-text" is the accompanying
      message text.  The "message-text" may include placeholders of the
      form "%1", "%2" etc.; these parameters are replaced by relevant
      values when the message is logged.
    </p><p>
      Each entry is also accompanied by a description giving more
      information about the circumstances that result in the message
      being logged.
    </p><p>
      For information on configuring and using BIND 10 logging,
      refer to the <a class="ulink" href="bind10-guide.html" target="_top">BIND 10 Guide</a>.

</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_FETCH_STOPPED"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_FETCH_STOPPED upstream fetch to %1(%2) has been stopped</span></dt><dd><p>
An external component has requested the halting of an upstream fetch.  This
is an allowed operation, and the message should only appear if debug is
enabled.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_OPEN_SOCKET"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_OPEN_SOCKET error %1 opening %2 socket to %3(%4)</span></dt><dd><p>
The asynchronous I/O code encountered an error when trying to open a socket
of the specified protocol in order to send a message to the target address.
The number of the system error that caused the problem is given in the
message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_READ_DATA"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_READ_DATA error %1 reading %2 data from %3(%4)</span></dt><dd><p>
The asynchronous I/O code encountered an error when trying to read data from

</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_READ_TIMEOUT"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_READ_TIMEOUT receive timeout while waiting for data from %1(%2)</span></dt><dd><p>
An upstream fetch from the specified address timed out.  This may happen for
any number of reasons and is most probably a problem at the remote server
or a problem on the network.  The message will only appear if debug is
enabled.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_SEND_DATA"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_SEND_DATA error %1 sending data using %2 to %3(%4)</span></dt><dd><p>
The asynchronous I/O code encountered an error when trying to send data to
the specified address on the given protocol.  The number of the system

</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_SYNC_UDP_CLOSE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_SYNC_UDP_CLOSE_FAIL failed to close a DNS/UDP socket: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This is the same to ASIODNS_UDP_CLOSE_FAIL but happens on the
"synchronous UDP server", mainly used for the authoritative DNS server
daemon.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_ACCEPT_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_ACCEPT_FAIL failed to accept TCP DNS connection: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
Accepting a TCP connection from a DNS client failed due to an error
that could happen but should be rare.  The reason for the error is
included in the log message.  The server still keeps accepting new
connections, so unless it happens often it's probably okay to ignore
this error.  If the shown error indicates something like "too many
open files", it's probably because the run time environment is too
restrictive on this limitation, so consider adjusing the limit using
a tool such as ulimit.  If you see other types of errors too often,
there may be something overlooked; please file a bug report in that case.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_CLEANUP_CLOSE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_CLEANUP_CLOSE_FAIL failed to close a DNS/TCP socket on port cleanup: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to close a TCP socket (one created on accepting
a new connection or is already unused) as a step of cleaning up the
corresponding listening port, but it failed to do that.  This is
generally an unexpected event and so is logged as an error.
See also the description of ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_ACCEPTOR_FAIL.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_ACCEPTOR_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_ACCEPTOR_FAIL failed to close listening TCP socket: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to close a listening TCP socket (for accepting
new connections) as a step of cleaning up the corresponding listening
port (e.g., on server shutdown or updating port configuration), but it
failed to do that.  This is generally an unexpected event and so is
logged as an error.  See ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_FAIL on the implication of
related system resources.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_FAIL failed to close DNS/TCP socket with a client: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to close a TCP socket used to communicate with
a client, but it failed to do that.  While closing a socket should
normally be an error-free operation, there have been known cases where
this happened with a "connection reset by peer" error.  This might be
because of some odd client behavior, such as sending a TCP RST after
establishing the connection and before the server closes the socket,
but how exactly this could happen seems to be system dependent (i.e,
it's not part of the standard socket API), so it's difficult to
provide a general explanation.  In any case, it is believed that an
error on closing a socket doesn't mean leaking system resources (the
kernel should clean up any internal resource related to the socket,
just reporting an error detected in the close call), but, again, it
seems to be system dependent.  This message is logged at a debug level
as it's known to happen and could be triggered by a remote node and it
would be better to not be too verbose, but you might want to increase
the log level and make sure there's no resource leak or other system
level troubles when it's logged.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_NORESP_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_NORESP_FAIL failed to close DNS/TCP socket with a client: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to close a TCP socket used to communicate with
a client without returning an answer (which normally happens for zone
transfer requests), but it failed to do that.  See ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_FAIL
for more details.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_GETREMOTE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_GETREMOTE_FAIL failed to get remote address of a DNS TCP connection: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to get the address and port of a remote client
on a connected socket but failed.  It's expected to be rare but can
still happen.  See also ASIODNS_TCP_READLEN_FAIL.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_READDATA_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_READDATA_FAIL failed to get DNS data on a TCP socket: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to read a DNS message (that follows a 2-byte
length field) but failed.  It's expected to be rare but can still happen.
See also ASIODNS_TCP_READLEN_FAIL.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_READLEN_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_READLEN_FAIL failed to get DNS data length on a TCP socket: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to get the length field of a DNS message (the first
2 bytes of a new chunk of data) but failed.  This is generally expected to
be rare but can still happen, e.g, due to an unexpected reset of the
connection.  A specific reason for the failure is included in the log
message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_WRITE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_WRITE_FAIL failed to send DNS message over a TCP socket: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to send a DNS message to a remote client but
failed.  It's expected to be rare but can still happen.  See also
ASIODNS_TCP_READLEN_FAIL.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_UDP_ASYNC_SEND_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_UDP_ASYNC_SEND_FAIL Error sending UDP packet to %1: %2</span></dt><dd><p>
The low-level ASIO library reported an error when trying to send a UDP
packet in asynchronous UDP mode. This can be any error reported by
send_to(), and can indicate problems such as too high a load on the network,
or a problem in the underlying library or system.
This packet is dropped and will not be sent, but service should resume
normally.
If you see a single occurrence of this message, it probably does not
indicate any significant problem, but if it is logged often, it is probably
a good idea to inspect your network traffic.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_UDP_CLOSE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_UDP_CLOSE_FAIL failed to close a DNS/UDP socket: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A UDP DNS server tried to close its UDP socket, but failed to do that.
This is generally an unexpected event and so is logged as an error.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_UDP_RECEIVE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_UDP_RECEIVE_FAIL failed to receive UDP DNS packet: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
Receiving a UDP packet from a DNS client failed due to an error that
could happen but should be very rare.  The server still keeps
receiving UDP packets on this socket.  The reason for the error is
included in the log message.  This log message is basically not
expected to appear at all in practice; if it does, there may be some
system level failure and other system logs may have to be checked.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_UDP_SYNC_RECEIVE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_UDP_SYNC_RECEIVE_FAIL failed to receive UDP DNS packet: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This is the same to ASIODNS_UDP_RECEIVE_FAIL but happens on the
"synchronous UDP server", mainly used for the authoritative DNS server
daemon.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_UDP_SYNC_SEND_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_UDP_SYNC_SEND_FAIL Error sending UDP packet to %1: %2</span></dt><dd><p>
The low-level ASIO library reported an error when trying to send a UDP
packet in synchronous UDP mode. See ASIODNS_UDP_ASYNC_SEND_FAIL for
more information.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_UNKNOWN_ORIGIN"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_UNKNOWN_ORIGIN unknown origin for ASIO error code %1 (protocol: %2, address %3)</span></dt><dd><p>
An internal consistency check on the origin of a message from the
asynchronous I/O module failed. This may indicate an internal error;
please submit a bug report.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_UNKNOWN_RESULT"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_UNKNOWN_RESULT unknown result (%1) when IOFetch::stop() was executed for I/O to %2(%3)</span></dt><dd><p>
An internal error indicating that the termination method of the resolver's
upstream fetch class was called with an unknown result code (which is
given in the message).  Please submit a bug report.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_AXFR_PROBLEM"></a><span class="term">AUTH_AXFR_PROBLEM error handling AXFR request: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message produced by the authoritative server when it
has encountered an error processing an AXFR request. The message gives
the reason for the error, and the server will return a SERVFAIL code to
the sender.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_AXFR_UDP"></a><span class="term">AUTH_AXFR_UDP AXFR query received over UDP</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message output when the authoritative server has received
an AXFR query over UDP. Use of UDP for AXFRs is not permitted by the
protocol, so the server will return a FORMERR error to the sender.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_COMMAND_FAILED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_COMMAND_FAILED execution of command channel instruction '%1' failed: %2</span></dt><dd><p>
Execution of the specified command by the authoritative server failed. The
message contains the reason for the failure.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_CONFIG_CHANNEL_CREATED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_CONFIG_CHANNEL_CREATED configuration session channel created</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message indicating that authoritative server has created
the channel to the configuration manager.  It is issued during server
startup is an indication that the initialization is proceeding normally.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_CONFIG_CHANNEL_ESTABLISHED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_CONFIG_CHANNEL_ESTABLISHED configuration session channel established</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message indicating that authoritative server
has established communication the configuration manager over the
previously-created channel. It is issued during server startup is an
indication that the initialization is proceeding normally.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_CONFIG_CHANNEL_STARTED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_CONFIG_CHANNEL_STARTED configuration session channel started</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message, issued when the authoritative server has
posted a request to be notified when new configuration information is
available. It is issued during server startup is an indication that
the initialization is proceeding normally.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL"></a><span class="term">AUTH_CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL load of configuration failed: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
An attempt to configure the server with information from the
configuration database during the startup sequence has failed.  The
server will continue its initialization although it may not be
configured in the desired way.  The reason for the failure is given in
the message.  One common reason is that the server failed to acquire a
socket bound to a privileged port (53 for DNS).  In that case the
reason in the log message should show something like "permission
denied", and the solution would be to restart BIND 10 as a super
(root) user.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_CONFIG_UPDATE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">AUTH_CONFIG_UPDATE_FAIL update of configuration failed: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
At attempt to update the configuration the server with information
from the configuration database has failed, the reason being given in
the message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_COMMAND"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_COMMAND data source builder received command: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A debug message, showing when the separate thread for maintaining data
source clients receives a command from the manager.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_COMMAND_ERROR"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_COMMAND_ERROR command execution failure: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
The separate thread for maintaining data source clients failed to complete a
command given by the main thread.  In most cases this is some kind of
configuration or temporary error such as an attempt to load a non-existent
zone or a temporary DB connection failure.  So the event is just logged and
the thread keeps running.  In some rare cases, however, this may indicate an
internal bug and it may be better to restart the entire program, so the log
message should be carefully examined.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_FAILED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_FAILED data source builder thread stopped due to an exception: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
The separate thread for maintaining data source clients has been
terminated due to some uncaught exception.  When this happens, the
thread immediately terminates the entire process because the manager
cannot always catch this condition in a timely fashion and it would be
worse to keep running with such a half-broken state.  This is really
an unexpected event and should generally indicate an internal bug.
It's advisable to file a bug report when this message is logged (and
b10-auth subsequently stops).
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_FAILED_UNEXPECTED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_FAILED_UNEXPECTED data source builder thread stopped due to an unexpected exception</span></dt><dd><p>
This is similar to AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_FAILED, but the
exception type indicates it's not thrown either within the BIND 10
implementation or other standard-compliant libraries.  This may rather
indicate some run time failure than program errors.  As in the other
failure case, the thread terminates the entire process immediately
after logging this message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_LOAD_ZONE"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_LOAD_ZONE loaded zone %1/%2</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is issued when the separate thread for maintaining data
source clients successfully loaded the named zone of the named class as a
result of the 'loadzone' command.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_LOAD_ZONE_NOCACHE"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_LOAD_ZONE_NOCACHE skipped loading zone %1/%2 due to no in-memory cache</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is issued when the separate thread for maintaining data
source clients received a command to reload a zone but skipped it because
the specified zone is not loaded in-memory (but served from an underlying
data source).  This could happen if the loadzone command is manually issued
by a user but the zone name is misspelled, but a more likely cause is
that the command is sent from another BIND 10 module (such as xfrin or DDNS).
In the latter case it can be simply ignored because there is no need
for explicit reloading.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_CONFIG_ERROR"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_CONFIG_ERROR Error in data source configuration: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
The thread for maintaining data source clients has received a command to
reconfigure, but the parameter data (the new configuration) contains an
error. The most likely cause is that the datasource-specific configuration
data is not what the data source expects. The system is still running with
the data sources that were previously configured (i.e. as if the
configuration has not changed), and the configuration data needs to be
checked.
The specific problem is printed in the log message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_DATASRC_ERROR"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_DATASRC_ERROR Error setting up data source: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
The thread for maintaining data source clients has received a command to
reconfigure, but a data source failed to set up. This may be a problem with
the data that is configured (e.g. unreadable files, inconsistent data,
parser problems, database connection problems, etc.), but it could be a bug
in the data source implementation as well. The system is still running with
the data sources that were previously configured (i.e. as if the
configuration has not changed).
The specific problem is printed in the log message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_ERROR"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_ERROR Internal error setting up data source: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
The thread for maintaining data source clients has received a command to
reconfigure, but raised an exception while setting up data sources. This is
most likely an internal error in a data source, or a bug in the data source
or the system itself, but it is probably a good idea to verify the
configuration first. The system is still running with the data sources that
were previously configured (i.e. as if the configuration has not changed).
The specific problem is printed in the log message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_STARTED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_STARTED data source reconfiguration started</span></dt><dd><p>
The thread for maintaining data source clients has received a command to
reconfigure, and has now started this process.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_SUCCESS"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_RECONFIGURE_SUCCESS data source reconfiguration completed successfully</span></dt><dd><p>
The thread for maintaining data source clients has finished reconfiguring
the data source clients, and is now running with the new configuration.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_STARTED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_STARTED data source builder thread started</span></dt><dd><p>
A separate thread for maintaining data source clients has been started.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_STOPPED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_BUILDER_STOPPED data source builder thread stopped</span></dt><dd><p>
The separate thread for maintaining data source clients has been stopped.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_SHUTDOWN_ERROR"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_SHUTDOWN_ERROR error on waiting for data source builder thread: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This indicates that the separate thread for maintaining data source
clients had been terminated due to an uncaught exception, and the
manager notices that at its own termination.  This is not an expected
event, because the thread is implemented so it catches all exceptions
internally.  So, if this message is logged it's most likely some internal
bug, and it would be nice to file a bug report.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_SHUTDOWN_UNEXPECTED_ERROR"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATASRC_CLIENTS_SHUTDOWN_UNEXPECTED_ERROR Unexpected error on waiting for data source builder thread</span></dt><dd><p>
Some exception happens while waiting for the termination of the
separate thread for maintaining data source clients.  This shouldn't
happen in normal conditions; it should be either fatal system level
errors such as severe memory shortage or some internal bug.  If that
happens, and if it's not in the middle of terminating b10-auth, it's
probably better to stop and restart it.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DATA_SOURCE"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DATA_SOURCE data source database file: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message produced by the authoritative server when it accesses a
database data source, listing the file that is being accessed.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_DNS_SERVICES_CREATED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_DNS_SERVICES_CREATED DNS services created</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message indicating that the component that will handling
incoming queries for the authoritative server (DNSServices) has been
successfully created. It is issued during server startup is an indication
that the initialization is proceeding normally.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_HEADER_PARSE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">AUTH_HEADER_PARSE_FAIL unable to parse header in received DNS packet: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message, generated by the authoritative server when an
attempt to parse the header of a received DNS packet has failed. (The
reason for the failure is given in the message.) The server will drop the
packet.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_INVALID_STATISTICS_DATA"></a><span class="term">AUTH_INVALID_STATISTICS_DATA invalid specification of statistics data specified</span></dt><dd><p>
An error was encountered when the authoritative server specified
statistics data which is invalid for the auth specification file.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_LOAD_TSIG"></a><span class="term">AUTH_LOAD_TSIG loading TSIG keys</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message indicating that the authoritative server
has requested the keyring holding TSIG keys from the configuration
database. It is issued during server startup is an indication that the
initialization is proceeding normally.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_MEM_DATASRC_DISABLED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_MEM_DATASRC_DISABLED memory data source is disabled for class %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message reporting that the authoritative server has
discovered that the memory data source is disabled for the given class.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_MEM_DATASRC_ENABLED"></a><span class="term">AUTH_MEM_DATASRC_ENABLED memory data source is enabled for class %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message reporting that the authoritative server has
discovered that the memory data source is enabled for the given class.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_MESSAGE_FORWARD_ERROR"></a><span class="term">AUTH_MESSAGE_FORWARD_ERROR failed to forward %1 request from %2: %3</span></dt><dd><p>
The authoritative server tried to forward some type DNS request
message to a separate process (e.g., forwarding dynamic update
requests to b10-ddns) to handle it, but it failed.  The authoritative
server returns SERVFAIL to the client on behalf of the separate
process.  The error could be configuration mismatch between b10-auth
and the recipient component, or it may be because the requests are
coming too fast and the recipient process cannot keep up with the
rate, or some system level failure.  In either case this means the
BIND 10 system is not working as expected, so the administrator should
look into the cause and address the issue.  The log message includes
the client's address (and port), and the error message sent from the
lower layer that detects the failure.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_NOTIFY_QUESTIONS"></a><span class="term">AUTH_NOTIFY_QUESTIONS invalid number of questions (%1) in incoming NOTIFY</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is logged by the authoritative server when it receives
a NOTIFY packet that contains zero or more than one question. (A valid
NOTIFY packet contains one question.) The server will return a FORMERR
error to the sender.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_NOTIFY_RRTYPE"></a><span class="term">AUTH_NOTIFY_RRTYPE invalid question RR type (%1) in incoming NOTIFY</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is logged by the authoritative server when it receives
a NOTIFY packet that an RR type of something other than SOA in the
question section. (The RR type received is included in the message.) The

</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_ZONEMGR_NOTEXIST"></a><span class="term">AUTH_ZONEMGR_NOTEXIST received NOTIFY but Zonemgr does not exist</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message produced by the authoritative server when it
receives a NOTIFY message but the Zonemgr component is not running at
that time.  Not running Zonemgr is completely valid for, e.g., primary
only servers, so this is not necessarily a problem.  If this message
is logged even if Zonemgr is supposed to be running, it's encouraged
to check other logs to identify why that happens.  It may or may not
be a real problem (for example, if it's immediately after the system
startup, it's possible that Auth has started up and is running but
Zonemgr is not yet).  Even if this is indeed an unexpected case,
Zonemgr should normally be restarted by the Init process, so unless
this repeats too often it may be negligible in practice (still it's
worth filing a bug report).  In any case, the authoritative server
simply drops the NOTIFY message; if it's a temporary failure or
delayed startup, subsequently resent messages will eventually reach
Zonemgr.

by starting BIND 10 with the -v command line option.  If it indicates

The b10-init module sent a single (either SIGTERM or SIGKILL) to a process,
but it failed due to some system level error.  There are two major cases:
the target process has already terminated but the b10-init module had sent
the signal before it noticed the termination.  In this case an error
message should indicate something like "no such process".  This can be
safely ignored.  The other case is that the b10-init module doesn't have
the privilege to send a signal to the process.  It can typically
happen when the b10-init module started as a privileged process, spawned a
subprocess, and then dropped the privilege.  It includes the case for
the socket creator when the b10-init process runs with the -u command line
option.  In this case, the b10-init module simply gives up to terminate
the process explicitly because it's unlikely to succeed by keeping
sending the signal.  Although the socket creator is implemented so
that it will terminate automatically when the b10-init process exits
(and that should be the case for any other future process running with
a higher privilege), but it's recommended to check if there's any
remaining BIND 10 process if this message is logged.  For all other
cases, the b10-init module will keep sending the signal until it confirms
all child processes terminate.  Although unlikely, this could prevent
the b10-init module from exiting, just keeping sending the signals.  So,
again, it's advisable to check if it really terminates when this
message is logged.

it to fail, so this means either a serious operational error in the
underlying data source (such as a system failure of a database) or
software bug in the underlying data source implementation.  In either
case if this message is logged the administrator should carefully
examine the underlying data source to see what exactly happens and
whether the data is still valid.  The zone name, its class, and the
underlying database name as well as the error message thrown from the
database module are shown in the log message.

b10-ddns tried to get configuration of some remote modules for its
operation, but it failed.  The most likely cause of this is that the
remote module has not fully started up and b10-ddns couldn't get the
configuration in a timely fashion.  b10-ddns attempts to retry it a
few times, imposing a short delay, hoping it eventually succeeds if
it's just a timing issue.  The number of total failed attempts is also
logged.  If it reaches an internal threshold b10-ddns considers it a
fatal error and terminates.  Even in that case, if b10-ddns is
configured as a "dispensable" component (which is the default), the
parent ("init") process will restart it, and there will be another
chance of getting the remote configuration successfully.  These are
not the optimal behavior, but it's believed to be sufficient in
practice (there would normally be no failure in the first place).  If
it really causes an operational trouble other than having a few of
these log messages, please submit a bug report; there can be several
ways to make it more sophisticated.  Another, less likely reason for
having this error is because the remote modules are not actually
configured to run.  If that's the case fixing the configuration should
solve the problem - either by making sure the remote module will run
or by not running b10-ddns (without these remote modules b10-ddns is
not functional, so there's no point in running it in this case).

b10-ddns received an update request via b10-auth, but the received
data failed to pass minimum validation: it was either broken wire
format data for a valid DNS message (e.g. it's shorter than the
fixed-length header), or the opcode is not update, or TSIG is included
in the request but it fails to validate.  Since b10-auth should have
performed this level of checks, such an error shouldn't be detected at

b10-ddns received a new update request from a client over TCP, but
the number of TCP clients being handled by the server already reached
the configured quota, so the latest client was rejected by closing
the connection.  The administrator may want to check the status of
b10-ddns, and if this happens even if the server is not very busy,
the quota may have to be increased.  Or, if it's more likely to be
malicious or simply bogus clients that somehow keep the TCP connection
open for a long period, maybe they should be rejected with an
appropriate ACL configuration or some lower layer filtering.  The
number of existing TCP clients are shown in the log, which should be
identical to the current quota.

b10-ddns had tried to send an update response over TCP, and it hadn't
been completed at that time, and a follow-up attempt to complete the
send operation failed due to some network I/O error.  While a network
error can happen any time, this event is quite unexpected for two
reasons.  First, since the size of a response to an update request
should be generally small, it's unlikely that the initial attempt
didn't fail but wasn't completed.  Second, since the first attempt
succeeded and the TCP connection had been established in the first
place, it's more likely for the subsequent attempt to succeed.  In any
case, there may not be able to do anything to fix it at the server
side, but the administrator may want to check the general reachability
with the client address.
</p></dd><dt><a name="DDNS_SECONDARY_ZONES_UPDATE"></a><span class="term">DDNS_SECONDARY_ZONES_UPDATE updated secondary zone list (%1 zones are listed)</span></dt><dd><p>
b10-ddns has successfully updated the internal copy of secondary zones
obtained from b10-zonemgr, based on a latest update to zonemgr's
configuration.  The number of newly configured (unique) secondary
zones is logged.
</p></dd><dt><a name="DDNS_SECONDARY_ZONES_UPDATE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">DDNS_SECONDARY_ZONES_UPDATE_FAIL failed to update secondary zone list: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
An error message.  b10-ddns was notified of updates to a list of
secondary zones from b10-zonemgr and tried to update its own internal
copy of the list, but it failed.  This can happen if the configuration
contains an error, and b10-zonemgr should also reject that update.
Unfortunately, in the current implementation there is no way to ensure
that both zonemgr and ddns have consistent information when an update
contains an error; further, as of this writing zonemgr has a bug that
it could partially update the list of secondary zones if part of the
list has an error (see Trac ticket #2038).  b10-ddns still keeps
running with the previous configuration, but it's strongly advisable
to check log messages from zonemgr, and if it indicates there can be
inconsistent state, it's better to restart the entire BIND 10 system
(just restarting b10-ddns wouldn't be enough, because zonemgr can have
partially updated configuration due to bug #2038).  The log message
contains an error description, but it's intentionally kept simple as
it's primarily a matter of zonemgr.  To know the details of the error,
log messages of zonemgr should be consulted.

</p></dd><dt><a name="DDNS_UPDATE_NOTIFY_FAIL"></a><span class="term">DDNS_UPDATE_NOTIFY_FAIL failed to notify %1 of updates to %2: %3</span></dt><dd><p>
b10-ddns has made updates to a zone based on an update request and
tried to notify an external component of the updates, but the
notification fails.  One possible cause of this is that the external
component is not really running, although it will be less likely to
happen in practice because these components will normally be
configured to run when the server provides the authoritative DNS
service; ddns is rather optional among them. Severity of this error
for the receiving components depends on the type of the component.  If
it's b10-xfrout, this means DNS notify messages won't be sent to
secondary servers of the zone.  It's suboptimal, but not necessarily
critical as the secondary servers will try to check the zone's status
periodically.  If it's b10-auth and the notification was needed to
have it reload the corresponding zone, it's more serious because
b10-auth won't be able to serve the new version of the zone unless
some explicit recovery action is taken.  So the administrator needs to
examine this message and takes an appropriate action.  In either case,
this notification is generally expected to succeed; so the fact it
fails itself means there's something wrong in the BIND 10 system, and
it would be advisable to check other log messages.

</p><p>
The most likely cause of this is that the specification file for the server

This warning message indicates that client tried to release an address
that belongs to a different client. This should not happen in normal
circumstances and may indicate a misconfiguration of the client.  However,
since the client releasing the address will stop using it anyway, there
is a good chance that the situation will correct itself.

A warning message indicating that a client is attempting to renew his lease,
but the server does not have any information about the subnet this client belongs
to. This may mean that faulty the mobile client changed its location and is trying to
renew its old address (client is supposed to send confirm, not rewew in such cases,
according to RFC3315) or the server configuration has changed and information about
existing subnet was removed. Note that in a sense this is worse case of DHCP6_UNKNOWN_RENEW,
as not only the lease is unknown, but also the subnet is. Depending on the reasons
of this condition, it may or may not correct on its own.

the server-id forbidden in that particular type of message is present,
there is more than one instance of client-id or server-id present,
etc. The exact reason for rejecting the packet is included in the message.

is normal behavior when the server is started for the first time. If
this message is printed every start, please check that the server have
sufficient permission to write its server-id file and that the file is not
corrupt.

This warning message is printed when client attempts to renew a lease,
but no such lease is known by the server. It typically means that
client has attempted to use its lease past its lifetime: causes of this
include a adjustment of the clients date/time setting or poor support
for sleep/recovery. A properly implemented client will recover from such
a situation by restarting the lease allocation process after receiving
a negative reply from the server.
</p><p>
An alternative cause could be that the server has lost its database
recently and does not recognize its well-behaving clients. This is more
probable if you see many such messages. Clients will recover from this,
but they will most likely get a different IP addresses and experience
a brief service interruption.

means that the updates will be applied to the zone but subsequent IXFR requests
will result in a full zone transfer (i.e., an AXFR-style IXFR).  Unless the
overhead of the full transfer is an issue this message can be ignored;
otherwise you may want to check why the journaling wasn't allowed on the

A debug message.  The msgq daemon was notified of a read event on a

client has closed its socket.  This is possible in a normal operation

</p></dd><dt><a name="MSGQ_CLOSE_ON_SEND"></a><span class="term">MSGQ_CLOSE_ON_SEND Sending to socket failed as already closed (okay to ignore on shutdown): FD=%1</span></dt><dd><p>
The msgq daemon tries to send some data to a client module, but it
failed because the socket has been closed.  This normally means the
client terminates (for some reason - either gracefully or as a crash)
while other modules try to send a message to the terminated module.
Since msgq doesn't keep track of the status of client modules, this
can happen and is not really an error for msgq; however, it can still
be an unexpected event for the BIND 10 system as a whole in that this
particular message is lost, so it's logged as a warning.  If this
message is logged for a running BIND 10 system, it's suggested to
check other log messages; there may be an error from other modules
reporting a missing response message.  One common, less critical case
where this message is logged is during shutdown.  The ordering of
process shutdown is basically arbitrary at this moment, so it's
possible that some module tries to send a "quitting" message to some
other module but the latter has already shut down.  Such cases are
generally non critical, but you may want to check other possible error
messages.

There was a low-level error when reading from a socket. The error is logged and
the corresponding socket is dropped.  The errors include receiving
broken or (non empty but) incomplete data.  In either case it usually suggests
something unexpected happens within the BIND 10 system; it's probably
better to restart the system, and if it continues it should be
reported as a bug.  One known, probably non critical case is
the "connection reset by peer" (or its variants) socket error appearing
on shutdown.  It's known this happens when the remote client closes the
connection as part of shutdown process.  Such cases are normally expected
to be reported as receiving empty data (which we log it at the debug level
as the MSGQ_CLOSE_ON_RECV message), but for some (yet) unknown reason
it can also be reported as the system error.  At shutdown time it's expected
that connections are closed, so it's probably safe to ignore these messages
in such a case.  We still log them as an error as we've not figured out
how exactly that can happen.  In future, we may make the shutdown process
more robust so the msgq daemon can explicitly know when a client shuts down
more reliably.  If and when it's implemented this error message won't appear
on shutdown unless there's really something unexpected.

RESOLVER_QUERY_REJECTED case, the server does not return any response.
The log message shows the query in the form of &lt;query name&gt;/&lt;query
type&gt;/&lt;query class&gt;, and the client that sends the query in the form of
&lt;Source IP address&gt;#&lt;source port&gt;.

This debug message lists the parameters being set for the resolver.  These are:
query timeout: the timeout (in ms) used for queries originated by the resolver
to upstream servers.  Client timeout: the interval to resolve a query by
a client: after this time, the resolver sends back a SERVFAIL to the client
whilst continuing to resolve the query. Lookup timeout: the time at which the
resolver gives up trying to resolve a query.  Retry count: the number of times
the resolver will retry a query to an upstream server if it gets a timeout.
</p><p>
The client and lookup timeouts require a bit more explanation. The
resolution of the client query might require a large number of queries to
upstream nameservers.  Even if none of these queries timeout, the total time
taken to perform all the queries may exceed the client timeout.  When this
happens, a SERVFAIL is returned to the client, but the resolver continues
with the resolution process; data received is added to the cache.  However,
there comes a time - the lookup timeout - when even the resolver gives up.
At this point it will wait for pending upstream queries to complete or
timeout and drop the query.

The serial fields of the first and last SOAs of AXFR (including AXFR-style

about this at the IETF dnsext working group:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dnsext/current/msg07908.html
and the general feeling seems that it would be better to reject the
transfer if a mismatch is detected.  On the other hand, also as noted
in that email thread, neither BIND 9 nor NSD performs any comparison
on the SOAs.  For now, we only check the serials (ignoring other fields)
and only leave a warning log message when a mismatch is found.  If it
turns out to happen with a real world primary server implementation
and that server actually feeds broken data (e.g. mixed versions of

therefore, for each changeset, there should at least be 1 deletion and 1
addition (the updated SOA record).

The first SOA record in an IXFR response indicates the zone's serial
at the primary server is not newer than the client's.  This is
basically unexpected event because normally the client first checks
the SOA serial by an SOA query, but can still happen if the transfer
is manually invoked or (although unlikely) there is a rapid change at
the primary server between the SOA and IXFR queries.  The client
implementation confirms the whole response is this single SOA, and
aborts the transfer just like a successful case.

The XFR transfer for the given zone has failed due to a problem outside

One common cause of this error could be a locked database; especially when

The XFR transfer for the given zone has failed due to a protocol
error, such as an unexpected response from the primary server.  The
error is shown in the log message.  It may be because the primary
server implementation is broken or (although less likely) there was
some attack attempt, but it can also happen due to configuration
mismatch such as the remote server does not have authority for the
zone any more but the local configuration hasn't been updated.  So it
is recommended to check the primary server configuration.

On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be
transferred is not found in the data source.  This can happen if a
secondary DNS server first tries to perform AXFR from a primary server
without creating the zone image beforehand (e.g. by b10-loadzone).  As
of this writing the xfrin process provides backward compatible
behavior to previous versions: creating a new one in the data source
not to surprise existing users too much.  This is probably not a good
idea, however, in terms of who should be responsible for managing
zones at a higher level.  In future it is more likely that a separate
zone management framework is provided, and the situation where the
given zone isn't found in xfrout will be treated as an error.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFRIN_ZONE_INVALID"></a><span class="term">XFRIN_ZONE_INVALID Newly received zone %1/%2 fails validation: %3</span></dt><dd><p>
The zone was received successfully, but it failed validation. The problem
is severe enough that the new version of zone is discarded and the old version,
if any, will stay in use. New transfer will be attempted after some time.
The problem needs to be fixed in the zone data on the remote server.

On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be
transferred has multiple SOA RRs.  Such a zone is broken, but could be
accidentally configured especially in a data source using "non
captive" backend database.  The implementation ignores entire SOA RRs
and tries to continue processing as if the zone were empty.  This
means subsequent AXFR can succeed and possibly replace the zone with
valid content, but an IXFR attempt will fail.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFRIN_ZONE_NO_SOA"></a><span class="term">XFRIN_ZONE_NO_SOA Zone %1 does not have SOA</span></dt><dd><p>
On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be
transferred does not have an SOA RR in the data source.  This is not
necessarily an error; if a secondary DNS server first tries to perform
transfer from a primary server, the zone can be empty, and therefore
doesn't have an SOA.  Subsequent AXFR will fill in the zone; if the
attempt is IXFR it will fail in query creation.

The response to an SOA query prior to xfr indicated that the zone's
SOA serial at the primary server is smaller than that of the xfrin
client.  This is not necessarily an error especially if that
particular primary server is another secondary server which hasn't got
the latest version of the zone.  But if the primary server is known to
be the real source of the zone, some unexpected inconsistency may have
happened, and you may want to take a closer look.  In this case xfrin
doesn't perform subsequent zone transfer.

Unless you know why this message was logged, and especially if it

A command received by the zone manager from another BIND 10 module did
not contain the name of the zone on which the zone manager should act.
This may be due to an internal programming error; please submit a
bug report.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_NOTIFY"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_NOTIFY received NOTIFY command for zone %1 (class %2)</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message indicating that the zone manager has received a
NOTIFY command over the command channel.  The command is sent by the Auth
process when it is acting as a slave server for the zone and causes the
zone manager to record the master server for the zone and start a timer;
when the timer expires, the master will be polled to see if it contains
new data.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_SHUTDOWN"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_SHUTDOWN received SHUTDOWN command</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message indicating that the zone manager has received
a SHUTDOWN command over the command channel from the Init process.
It will act on this command and shut down.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_UNKNOWN"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_UNKNOWN received unknown command '%1'</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a warning message indicating that the zone manager has received
the stated command over the command channel.  The command is not known
to the zone manager and although the command is ignored, its receipt
may indicate an internal error.  Please submit a bug report.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_XFRIN_FAILED"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_XFRIN_FAILED received XFRIN FAILED command for zone %1 (class %2)</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message indicating that the zone manager has received
an XFRIN FAILED command over the command channel.  The command is sent
by the Xfrin process when a transfer of zone data into the system has
failed, and causes the zone manager to schedule another transfer attempt.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_XFRIN_SUCCESS"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_XFRIN_SUCCESS received XFRIN SUCCESS command for zone %1 (class %2)</span></dt><dd><p>
This is a debug message indicating that the zone manager has received
an XFRIN SUCCESS command over the command channel.  The command is sent
by the Xfrin process when the transfer of zone data into the system has
succeeded, and causes the data to be loaded and served by BIND 10.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_REFRESH_ZONE"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_REFRESH_ZONE refreshing zone %1 (class %2)</span></dt><dd><p>

with updated information.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_SELECT_ERROR"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_SELECT_ERROR error with select(): %1</span></dt><dd><p>
An attempt to wait for input from a socket failed.  The failing operation
is a call to the operating system's select() function, which failed for
the given reason.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_SEND_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_SEND_FAIL failed to send command to %1, session has been closed</span></dt><dd><p>
The zone manager attempted to send a command to the named BIND 10 module,
but the send failed.  The session between the modules has been closed.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_SESSION_ERROR"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_SESSION_ERROR unable to establish session to command channel daemon</span></dt><dd><p>
The zonemgr process was not able to be started because it could not
connect to the command channel daemon.  The most usual cause of this
problem is that the daemon is not running.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_SESSION_TIMEOUT"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_SESSION_TIMEOUT timeout on session to command channel daemon</span></dt><dd><p>
The zonemgr process was not able to be started because it timed out when
connecting to the command channel daemon.  The most usual cause of this
problem is that the daemon is not running.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_SHUTDOWN"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_SHUTDOWN zone manager has shut down</span></dt><dd><p>
The zone manager has shut down completely.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_STARTED"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_STARTED zonemgr started</span></dt><dd><p>

</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_TIMER_THREAD_RUNNING"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_TIMER_THREAD_RUNNING trying to start timer thread but one is already running</span></dt><dd><p>
This message is issued when an attempt is made to start the timer
thread (which keeps track of when zones need a refresh) but one is
already running.  It indicates either an error in the program logic or
a problem with stopping a previous instance of the timer.  Please submit
a bug report.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_UNKNOWN_ZONE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_UNKNOWN_ZONE_FAIL zone %1 (class %2) is not known to the zone manager</span></dt><dd><p>
An XFRIN operation has failed but the zone that was the subject of the
operation is not being managed by the zone manager. This can be either the
result of a bindctl command to transfer in a currently unknown (or mistyped)
zone, or, if this error appears without the administrator giving transfer
commands, it can indicate an error in the program, as it should not have
initiated transfers of unknown zones on its own.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_UNKNOWN_ZONE_SUCCESS"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_UNKNOWN_ZONE_SUCCESS zone %1 (class %2) is not known to the zone manager</span></dt><dd><p>
An XFRIN operation has succeeded but the zone received is not being
managed by the zone manager.  This may indicate an error in the program
(as the operation should not have been initiated if this were the case).
Please submit a bug report.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ZONEMGR_ZONE_NOTIFY_NOT_SECONDARY"></a><span class="term">ZONEMGR_ZONE_NOTIFY_NOT_SECONDARY notify for zone %1/%2 from %3 received but not in secondaries</span></dt><dd><p>
A NOTIFY was received but the zone is not listed in the configured
secondary zones of the zone manager.  The most common reason for this
is that it's simply received by a primary server of the zone.  Another
possibility is a configuration error that it's not configured as a
secondary while it should be.  In either case, the zone manager does
not take action in terms of zone management, and the authoritative
server will respond to it like in the secondary case.  If this is a
configuration error, it will be noticed by the fact that the zone
isn't updated even after a change is made in the primary server.
